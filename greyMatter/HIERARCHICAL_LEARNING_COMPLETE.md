- **Examples**: "bigger than", "same color", cause-effect relationships
- **Prerequisites**: Object recognition and basic categorization
- **Storage Path**: `layer_3_relationalunderstanding/functional/general/plasticity/stable_mature/`

#### **Layer 3: Abstract Concepts** (Social & Emotional Understanding)
- **Purpose**: Complex social, emotional, and abstract thinking
- **Examples**: Friendship, justice, beauty, complex emotions
