## üéØ What is greyMatter?

greyMatter is an experimental neural learning system inspired by biological brain architecture. Instead of traditional static neural networks, it creates **ephemeral neural clusters** that are procedurally generated on-demand. The central inspiration: "If we can simulate entire galaxies through common-seed procedural functions, albeit at lower fidelity and with a limited local-scoping, why can't we overcome the scale limitations with neural networks through similar concepts?"

**Core Philosophy / Question**: Can higher level cognition emerge through complex interactions between specialized, short-lived neural structures rather than through massive parameter counts or computational brute force?

## üß¨ Core Architecture

### TrainingService - Unified Learning Interface (NEW!)
Centralized service that replaced 80+ scattered demo classes:
- **Parameterized Training**: `RunTatoebaTrainingAsync()`, `RunLLMTeacherSessionAsync()`
- **Performance Validation**: `RunPerformanceValidationAsync()`
- **Configuration Management**: Unified parameter classes for all training modes
- **Result Tracking**: Standardized training results and metrics

### LLM-Guided Neural Learning System
**‚úÖ REVOLUTIONARY IMPLEMENTATION: Complete LLM-guided continuous learning system**:

**Intelligent Teacher Integration:**
- **External LLM API**: Ollama endpoint (http://192.168.69.138:11434) with deepseek-r1:1.5b model
- **Real-time Strategy Analysis**: LLM analyzes vocabulary size, learning rate, accuracy, recent words
- **Dynamic Curriculum Generation**: Creates personalized learning phases based on progress
- **Structured JSON Communication**: Type-safe responses with confidence scoring
- **Multi-mode Operation**: Interactive guidance + background continuous learning

**Advanced Learning Capabilities:**
- **Sparse Activation Patterns**: Each word creates unique SDR (Sparse Distributed Representation) with ~2% neuron activation
- **Neural Activation Storage**: Stores actual activation signatures `{ActivationSignature: [1,5,12,45,78...], ActivationStrength: 0.85}` instead of metadata
- **Synaptic Weight Encoding**: Word relationships encoded as overlapping neural patterns with measured connection strengths
- **Biological Pattern Formation**: Related concepts share neurons (like "cat"‚Üí[1,5,12] and "dog"‚Üí[1,5,78] sharing neurons 1,5)
- **Dynamic Memory Consolidation**: Repeated exposure strengthens neural activation patterns over time

**Interactive Learning Features:**
- **Live Commands**: `status` (progress analysis), `focus <topic>` (guided data source selection)
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Scientific, conversational, news, technical data sources
- **Real-time Strategy Adjustment**: LLM adapts learning approach based on performance
- **Background Processing**: Continuous learning with interactive LLM overlay

**üéØ ACTUAL NEURAL LEARNING**: System now stores neural activation signatures, not JSON dictionaries

### Ephemeral Neural Clusters
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Neural structures created on-demand for specific cognitive tasks
- **Shared Neurons**: Concepts share neural resources (like Venn diagrams)
- **FMRI-like Visualization**: Real-time brain activity visualization
- **Biological Fatigue**: Neurons experience realistic usage patterns

### Procedural Generation
- **Cortical Columns**: Specialized processing units generated as needed
- **Minimal Persistence**: Only essential patterns stored, details procedurally regenerated
- **Semantic Clustering**: Related concepts grouped in biological-style "brain regions"

## üìä Project Status (October 2025)

**Phase 0 Foundation Cleanup: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

This repository is an active research prototype with core systems operational and a clear path forward. Recent Phase 0 cleanup significantly improved code quality and maintainability.

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs working now
- Training entry points and demos build and run; core classes for brains, storage, learners, and evaluators are present.
- TrainingService exists and is being adopted, but legacy demos still exist alongside it.
- LLM Teacher integration (Ollama/deepseek-r1:1.5b) is wired up and can drive interactive sessions; analysis logic is evolving.
- Multi-source data provider has been cleaned up to remove static fallback generators; it now expects real datasets on disk.
- Storage layer includes a FastStorageAdapter implementation; migration from legacy paths is in progress.
- Continuous learning can process large word counts and autosave; validation now reads the same storage used by training.

### üõ†Ô∏è In Progress / Next Steps

**Phase 1: Storage & Persistence (2-4 weeks)**
- Complete FastStorageAdapter migration across remaining code paths
- Add versioned schema with integrity checks
- Implement periodic snapshots and quick-restore capability
- **Goal**: Save/load 50k-100k concepts in seconds

**Phase 2: Procedural Neural Core (4-6 weeks) - CRITICAL PATH**
- Activate ProceduralCorticalColumnGenerator in learn/recall pipeline
- Implement working memory APIs and inter-column messaging
- Add attention/temporal gating mechanisms
- **Goal**: Test core "emergence through interaction" hypothesis

**Phase 3-5**: LLM maturation, evaluation harness, scaling (see Roadmap)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations
- Some documentation previously overstated ‚Äúproduction-ready‚Äù status; treat this repo as an R&D codebase.
- Many demo classes remain; expect overlap and older patterns until consolidation completes.
- Performance figures vary by configuration and are still being characterized; avoid assuming prior headline numbers.
- Data sources require local files; no static, synthetic fallbacks remain. Missing data will error with clear messages.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Biological Inspiration
1. **Sparse Activation**: Only relevant neural clusters active at any time
2. **Procedural Details**: Complex structures generated from simple rules
3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Neural fatigue, consolidation, forgetting
4. **Hierarchical Organization**: From sensory primitives to abstract concepts

### No Man's Sky Analogy
Just as No Man's Sky doesn't store every planet's details but generates them procedurally within render distance, greyMatter generates neural complexity on-demand within the "cognitive render distance" of current tasks.

- Route CLI/Program.cs through TrainingService for all modes; retire legacy demo entry points incrementally.
- Acceptance: one canonical ‚Äúlearn/validate‚Äù path; data path issues fail fast with actionable messages.

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Storage and Persistence (2‚Äì4 weeks)
- Complete FastStorageAdapter migration; quarantine legacy storage behind a compatibility shim
- Add versioned schema and small integrity checks; implement periodic snapshots and quick-restore
- **Acceptance**: Save/load within seconds for 50k‚Äì100k concepts; validated by Performance Validation task

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Procedural Neural Core (4‚Äì6 weeks) - CRITICAL PATH
- Flesh out ProceduralCorticalColumnGenerator with consistent column templates and connection rules
- Implement working memory APIs and inter-column messaging primitives; basic attention/temporal gating
- **Acceptance**: Measurable reuse/regeneration of columns across sessions; unit tests for regeneration correctness
- **WHY CRITICAL**: Tests core "emergence through interaction" hypothesis

### Phase 3 ‚Äî LLM Teacher Maturation (parallel, 3‚Äì5 weeks)
