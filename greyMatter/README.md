# greyMatter - Biologically-Inspired Neural Learning System üß†

> **Vision**: Procedural generation meets neuroscience - creating dynamic, efficient neural structures that scale through biological principles, not brute force.

## üéØ What is greyMatter?

greyMatter is an experimental neural learning system inspired by biological brain architecture. Instead of traditional static neural networks, it creates **ephemeral neural clusters** that are procedurally generated on-demand. The central inspiration: "If we can simulate entire galaxies through common-seed procedural functions, albeit at lower fidelity and with a limited local-scoping, why can't we overcome the scale limitations with neural networks through similar concepts?"

**Core Philosophy / Question**: Can higher level cognition emerge through complex interactions between specialized, short-lived neural structures rather than through massive parameter counts or computational brute force?

## üß¨ Core Architecture

### TrainingService - Unified Learning Interface (NEW!)
Centralized service that replaced 80+ scattered demo classes:
- **Parameterized Training**: `RunTatoebaTrainingAsync()`, `RunLLMTeacherSessionAsync()`
- **Performance Validation**: `RunPerformanceValidationAsync()`
- **Configuration Management**: Unified parameter classes for all training modes
- **Result Tracking**: Standardized training results and metrics

### LLM-Guided Neural Learning System
**‚úÖ REVOLUTIONARY IMPLEMENTATION: Complete LLM-guided continuous learning system**:

**Intelligent Teacher Integration:**
- **External LLM API**: Ollama endpoint (http://192.168.69.138:11434) with deepseek-r1:1.5b model
- **Real-time Strategy Analysis**: LLM analyzes vocabulary size, learning rate, accuracy, recent words
- **Dynamic Curriculum Generation**: Creates personalized learning phases based on progress
- **Structured JSON Communication**: Type-safe responses with confidence scoring
- **Multi-mode Operation**: Interactive guidance + background continuous learning

**Advanced Learning Capabilities:**
- **Sparse Activation Patterns**: Each word creates unique SDR (Sparse Distributed Representation) with ~2% neuron activation
- **Neural Activation Storage**: Stores actual activation signatures `{ActivationSignature: [1,5,12,45,78...], ActivationStrength: 0.85}` instead of metadata
- **Synaptic Weight Encoding**: Word relationships encoded as overlapping neural patterns with measured connection strengths
- **Biological Pattern Formation**: Related concepts share neurons (like "cat"‚Üí[1,5,12] and "dog"‚Üí[1,5,78] sharing neurons 1,5)
- **Dynamic Memory Consolidation**: Repeated exposure strengthens neural activation patterns over time

**Interactive Learning Features:**
- **Live Commands**: `status` (progress analysis), `focus <topic>` (guided data source selection)
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Scientific, conversational, news, technical data sources
- **Real-time Strategy Adjustment**: LLM adapts learning approach based on performance
- **Background Processing**: Continuous learning with interactive LLM overlay

**üéØ ACTUAL NEURAL LEARNING**: System now stores neural activation signatures, not JSON dictionaries

### Ephemeral Neural Clusters
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Neural structures created on-demand for specific cognitive tasks
- **Shared Neurons**: Concepts share neural resources (like Venn diagrams)
- **FMRI-like Visualization**: Real-time brain activity visualization
- **Biological Fatigue**: Neurons experience realistic usage patterns

### Procedural Generation
- **Cortical Columns**: Specialized processing units generated as needed
- **Minimal Persistence**: Only essential patterns stored, details procedurally regenerated
- **Semantic Clustering**: Related concepts grouped in biological-style "brain regions"

## üìä Project Status (September 2025)

This repository is an active research prototype with several promising systems in place, plus areas that need consolidation and hardening. The sections below reflect the current, accurate state based on code and recent changes.

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs working now
- Training entry points and demos build and run; core classes for brains, storage, learners, and evaluators are present.
- TrainingService exists and is being adopted, but legacy demos still exist alongside it.
- LLM Teacher integration (Ollama/deepseek-r1:1.5b) is wired up and can drive interactive sessions; analysis logic is evolving.
- Multi-source data provider has been cleaned up to remove static fallback generators; it now expects real datasets on disk.
- Storage layer includes a FastStorageAdapter implementation; migration from legacy paths is in progress.
- Continuous learning can process large word counts and autosave; validation now reads the same storage used by training.

### üõ†Ô∏è In progress / needs work
- Consolidating all training flows through TrainingService; retiring the many legacy demo entry points.
- Finalizing the switch to FastStorageAdapter across all code paths; removing or isolating older storage managers.
- Strengthening dataset handling (paths, formats, error messages) and adding minimal smoke tests per data source.
- Tightening LLM Teacher loop (clear contracts, reliability, and evaluation hooks) and documenting failure modes.
- Biological features (working memory, inter-column communication, attention/temporal binding) are mostly stubs/frameworks.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations
- Some documentation previously overstated ‚Äúproduction-ready‚Äù status; treat this repo as an R&D codebase.
- Many demo classes remain; expect overlap and older patterns until consolidation completes.
- Performance figures vary by configuration and are still being characterized; avoid assuming prior headline numbers.
- Data sources require local files; no static, synthetic fallbacks remain. Missing data will error with clear messages.

### üìÇ Training data location
- Default training data root: `/Volumes/jarvis/trainData`
- Expected examples:
	- News: `news/headlines.txt`
	- Scientific: `scientific/abstracts.txt`
	- Technical: `technical/documentation.txt`
	- Enhanced/CBT/Wiki files as configured in code
	Ensure these exist or adjust the constructor/paths where appropriate.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Biological Inspiration
1. **Sparse Activation**: Only relevant neural clusters active at any time
2. **Procedural Details**: Complex structures generated from simple rules
3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Neural fatigue, consolidation, forgetting
4. **Hierarchical Organization**: From sensory primitives to abstract concepts

### No Man's Sky Analogy
Just as No Man's Sky doesn't store every planet's details but generates them procedurally within render distance, greyMatter generates neural complexity on-demand within the "cognitive render distance" of current tasks.
