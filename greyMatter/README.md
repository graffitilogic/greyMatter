# greyMatter - Biologically-Inspired Neural Learning System üß†

> **Vision**: Procedural generation meets neuroscience - creating dynamic, efficient neural structures that scale through biological principles, not brute force.

## üéØ What is greyMatter?

greyMatter is an experimental neural learning system inspired by biological brain architecture. Instead of traditional static neural networks, it creates **ephemeral neural clusters** that are procedurally generated on-demand. The central inspiration: "If we can simulate entire galaxies through common-seed procedural functions, albeit at lower fidelity and with a limited local-scoping, why can't we overcome the scale limitations with neural networks through similar concepts?"

**Core Philosophy / Question**: Can higher level cognition emerge through complex interactions between specialized, short-lived neural structures rather than through massive parameter counts or computational brute force?

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Biological Inspiration
1. **Sparse Activation**: Only relevant neural clusters active at any time
2. **Procedural Details**: Complex structures generated from simple rules
