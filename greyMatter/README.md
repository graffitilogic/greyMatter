## üî¨ Research Philosophy

**Standard**: Test everything. No "COMPLETE" claims without validation. Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Document ‚Üí Repeat.

**Status Levels**:
- üèóÔ∏è **Framework**: Code exists, compiles, never executed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Prototype**: Executed 1-2 times, may have issues  
- ‚úÖ **Validated**: Executed 3+ times, results consistent
- üöÄ **Production**: Used in real workflows, stable over time

---

**Last Updated**: October 7, 2025

**Data & Storage**
- Multi-source data provider expects real datasets (synthetic fallbacks removed for quality)
- FastStorageAdapter migration ~80% complete; legacy paths being phased out
- Storage validation now tests the same paths used by training (previously disconnected)scale through biological principles, not brute force.

## üéØ What is greyMatter?

greyMatter is an **experimental research prototype** exploring neural learning systems inspired by biological brain architecture. The goal is to create **ephemeral neural clusters** that are procedurally generated on-demand, rather than using traditional static neural networks.

**Central Inspiration**: "If we can simulate entire galaxies through common-seed procedural functions, why can't we overcome scale limitations with neural networks through similar concepts?"

**Core Research Question**: Can higher level cognition emerge through complex interactions between specialized, short-lived neural structures rather than through massive parameter counts or computational brute force?

**Current Reality**: We have a working single-source learning system with fast binary storage. The "emergence through column interactions" hypothesis remains **untested** - column architecture code exists but has never been executed.

## üß¨ Core Architecture

### What Actually Works

#### TrainingService - Unified Learning Interface
Centralized service that replaced 80+ scattered demo classes:
- **Parameterized Training**: `RunTatoebaTrainingAsync()`, `RunLLMTeacherSessionAsync()`
- **Performance Validation**: `RunPerformanceValidationAsync()`
- **Configuration Management**: Unified parameter classes for all training modes
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **Validated** - Successfully consolidated training infrastructure

#### LLM Teacher Integration
**Ollama API integration for learning guidance**:

**What Works:**
- **External LLM API**: Ollama endpoint with deepseek-r1:1.5b model
- **Interactive Guidance**: User can ask questions during learning sessions
- **Structured JSON Communication**: Type-safe responses from LLM
- **Multi-mode Operation**: Interactive guidance + background learning loops

**Current Limitations:**
- LLM provides recommendations but execution is mostly manual
- No proven improvement in learning outcomes vs. non-LLM baseline
- "Dynamic curriculum generation" is theoretical - requires testing

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Prototype** - Works but impact unvalidated

#### Single-Source Learning (Tatoeba)
**Proven working system**:
- **TatoebaLanguageTrainer**: Reads CSV sentences, extracts concepts
- **LanguageEphemeralBrain**: Creates neural clusters for words
- **Sparse Activation Patterns**: Each word gets unique sparse representation
- **Neural Activation Storage**: Stores activation signatures with strengths
- **Save/Load**: Persists and restores brain state

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Validated** - Multiple successful training runs

#### Fast Binary Storage
**MessagePack-based storage system**:
- **FastStorageAdapter**: Binary serialization (vs JSON)
- **Proven Performance**: 1,350x speedup (0.4s vs 540s for 5K vocabulary)
- **Simple Interface**: Save/Load brain state as Dictionary<string, object>

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Validated** - Production-ready performance

### What's Framework-Only (Untested)

#### Column-Based Cognitive Architecture
**Code exists but never executed**:
- **WorkingMemory** (328 lines): Manages active concepts with decay
- **MessageBus** (421 lines): Inter-column communication protocol
- **AttentionSystem** (390 lines): Task-specific focus with profiles
- **ColumnBasedProcessor** (509 lines): Routes inputs through column pipeline
- **ProceduralCorticalColumnGenerator** (505 lines): Template-based column generation

**Current Reality**: All classes compile. Zero test runs. Completely unvalidated.

**Status**: üèóÔ∏è **Framework Only** - Needs first execution and debugging

#### Multi-Source Data Integration
**Partial implementation**:
- ‚úÖ **Tatoeba**: CSV reader working
- üèóÔ∏è **News/Wikipedia/Subtitles/etc**: Code exists, file paths unclear, untested
- üèóÔ∏è **LLM-guided source selection**: Theoretical - manual wiring required

**Current Reality**: 1 of 8 claimed sources proven working.

**Status**: üèóÔ∏è **Mostly Theoretical** - Need to test with real files

#### Procedural Column Generation
**Not integrated**:
- Template methods exist for phonetic, semantic, syntactic columns
- Not wired into any learning pipeline
- No regeneration flow implemented
- No efficiency measurements

**Status**: üèóÔ∏è **Framework Only** - Need to wire into learning

## üìä Project Status (October 2025)

**Phase 0 Foundation Cleanup: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

This repository is an active research prototype with core systems operational and a clear path forward. Recent Phase 0 cleanup significantly improved code quality and maintainability.

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs working now
- Training entry points and demos build and run; core classes for brains, storage, learners, and evaluators are present.
- TrainingService exists and is being adopted, but legacy demos still exist alongside it.
- LLM Teacher integration (Ollama/deepseek-r1:1.5b) is wired up and can drive interactive sessions; analysis logic is evolving.
- Multi-source data provider has been cleaned up to remove static fallback generators; it now expects real datasets on disk.
- Storage layer includes a FastStorageAdapter implementation; migration from legacy paths is in progress.
- Continuous learning can process large word counts and autosave; validation now reads the same storage used by training.

### üõ†Ô∏è In Progress / Next Steps

**Phase 1: Storage & Persistence (2-4 weeks)**
- Complete FastStorageAdapter migration across remaining code paths
- Add versioned schema with integrity checks
- Implement periodic snapshots and quick-restore capability
- **Goal**: Save/load 50k-100k concepts in seconds

**Phase 2: Procedural Neural Core (4-6 weeks) - CRITICAL PATH**
- Activate ProceduralCorticalColumnGenerator in learn/recall pipeline
- Implement working memory APIs and inter-column messaging
- Add attention/temporal gating mechanisms
- **Goal**: Test core "emergence through interaction" hypothesis

**Phase 3-5**: LLM maturation, evaluation harness, scaling (see Roadmap)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations
- Some documentation previously overstated ‚Äúproduction-ready‚Äù status; treat this repo as an R&D codebase.
- Many demo classes remain; expect overlap and older patterns until consolidation completes.
- Performance figures vary by configuration and are still being characterized; avoid assuming prior headline numbers.
- Data sources require local files; no static, synthetic fallbacks remain. Missing data will error with clear messages.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

### Biological Inspiration
1. **Sparse Activation**: Only relevant neural clusters active at any time
2. **Procedural Details**: Complex structures generated from simple rules
3. **Temporal Dynamics**: Neural fatigue, consolidation, forgetting
4. **Hierarchical Organization**: From sensory primitives to abstract concepts

### No Man's Sky Analogy
Just as No Man's Sky doesn't store every planet's details but generates them procedurally within render distance, greyMatter generates neural complexity on-demand within the "cognitive render distance" of current tasks.

**Bottom Line**: greyMatter is an active R&D project demonstrating that biologically-inspired neural patterns + LLM-guided learning + procedural generation can achieve sophisticated learning behaviors. Phase 0 foundation cleanup is complete, providing a clean base for testing core emergence hypotheses in Phase 2.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap to Desired End-State

**Goal**: A trained system that hydrates cortical columns procedurally with minimal persistence during learning and can regenerate structures on demand during recognition/response, with continuous background consolidation.

Phase 0 ‚Äî Foundation cleanup (now ‚Üí 2 weeks)
- Remove synthetic/static fallbacks (done for multi-source provider); enforce real datasets with explicit errors.
- Normalize configuration: single TrainingConfiguration (paths, batch sizes, storage adapter, teacher options).
- Route CLI/Program.cs through TrainingService for all modes; retire legacy demo entry points incrementally.
- Acceptance: one canonical ‚Äúlearn/validate‚Äù path; data path issues fail fast with actionable messages.

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Storage and Persistence (2‚Äì4 weeks)
- Complete FastStorageAdapter migration; quarantine legacy storage behind a compatibility shim
- Add versioned schema and small integrity checks; implement periodic snapshots and quick-restore
- **Acceptance**: Save/load within seconds for 50k‚Äì100k concepts; validated by Performance Validation task

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Procedural Neural Core (4‚Äì6 weeks) - CRITICAL PATH
- Flesh out ProceduralCorticalColumnGenerator with consistent column templates and connection rules
- Implement working memory APIs and inter-column messaging primitives; basic attention/temporal gating
- **Acceptance**: Measurable reuse/regeneration of columns across sessions; unit tests for regeneration correctness
- **WHY CRITICAL**: Tests core "emergence through interaction" hypothesis

### Phase 3 ‚Äî LLM Teacher Maturation (parallel, 3‚Äì5 weeks)
- Define strict contracts (inputs/outputs) for AnalyzeLearningState, ProvideConceptualMapping, SuggestCurriculum
- Add reliability guards: retries, timeouts, structured validation, and telemetry of teacher decisions
- **Acceptance**: Teacher-driven focus measurably improves retention and learning rate on a fixed benchmark

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Data and Evaluation Harness (3‚Äì4 weeks)
- Canonicalize data formats and loaders (news/science/tech/subtitles/wiki); add per-source smoke tests
- Build an evaluation harness for vocabulary growth, retention, and domain coverage
- **Acceptance**: Green smoke tests on all sources; repeatable evaluation runs with tracked metrics

Phase 5 ‚Äî Scaling and visualization (future)
- Batch/parallel processing of concept clusters; live visualization hooks of ‚Äúfmri-like‚Äù activity.
- Multi-modal expansion (text-first ‚Üí text+audio+vision) behind clean interfaces.
- Acceptance: stable runs at 100k+ vocabulary, with interactive status and visualization.
