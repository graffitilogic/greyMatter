# Training Efficacy Issues - 128k Word Training Analysis
*Analysis Date: September 13, 2025*

## üéØ Executive Summary
After training on 128k words, the system achieved only **40% learning validation score** due to fundamental gaps between data processing and pattern utilization. The system is falling back to algorithmic pattern generation instead of using learned data.
