# Project GreyMatter 
Neurobiologically-inspired Experiments in novel machine learning patterns.

## **PURPOSE**

Discovery and experiments of novel neural network concepts, borrowing and remixing concepts from neurobiology. 

## **PHILOSOPHY**
Modern LLM's are incredibly capable tools, especially considering that are built atop a brute-force philosophy that priorities parameters over neural architecture.  Scale is everything.  If you have an infinite number of chimps banging away at an infinite number of keyboards, an infinite subset of chimps will eventually type out the Complete Works of William Shakespeare.  

On the biological side, the human brain's massive scale in neurobiological architecture compared to our lack of ability to truly relate to vast economies of scale poses a key evolutionary boundary towards biological superintelligence.  On the computational side, a collection of weights stored in a model file will never *be* Artificial General Intelligence. 

But, I believe that well-meaning chimps and massively scaled LLMs may to overcome their boundaries and build something with virtually limitless cognitive ability. 

This is a humble, self-taught programmer's attempt to discover what we know, apply concepts in unique ways and see what happens.
